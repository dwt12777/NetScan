MAC VENDOR CACHE
----------------
Netscan uses a third party provider (https://macvendors.com/) to retrieve MAC vendor names. The process is throttled to allow one lookup per second. However, Netscan caches the results so that subsequent executions use the cached data and return your results much faster. By default, the items are cached for 365 days. You can change that by editing the file "NetScan.dll.config" found in the installation directory.
