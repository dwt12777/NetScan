MAC VENDOR CACHE
----------------
Netscan uses a third party provider (https://macvendors.com/) to lookup MAC vendor names. The process is throttled to allow one lookup per second. However the results are cached so that subsequent netscan runs can use the cached data and return results much faster. Only new MAC addresses require the external lookup. By default, the items are cached for 365 days. However you can change that by editing the file "NetScan.dll.config" found in the installation directory.
